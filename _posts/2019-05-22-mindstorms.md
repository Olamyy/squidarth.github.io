When personal computers first entered the scene in the 70s,
there was a lot of excitement about the ways in which computers
would dramatically change the way people live. While that has
undoubtedly happened, there are still some unfulfilled promises.
One of these unfulfilled promises--the promise that computers would
radically change how *learning* works is wonderfully captured by
Seyour Papert's 1980 [Mindstorms](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/703532.Mindstorms).

Now, clearly computers *have* made it into the classrooms, and
when I was going to school at least, definitely played a big
role in my education.

However, what Papert was observing at the time that he wrote the
book was that most of "using a computer in the classroom" was a simple
porting of pre-computer educational concepts to the computer. As an example,
submitting physics homework online and getting immediate feedback, rather
than have to wait for a grader.

The analogy that Papert uses for this is the **QWERTY** keyboard. The keyboard that is
standard on all computers today is not the most efficient or easiest on the hands.
In fact, the reason it is laid out the way it is because it was originally developed
for typewriters, where there was a constraint where if keys next to each other were
too frequently used, the keys would jam. That isn't a constraint for modern keyboards,
yet, the layout has stayed.

In *Mindstorms*, Papert digs into what constraints from the analogue world we are still
stuck. I think his ideas are
interesting not just because of their potential to change how childhood education works,
but also because he asks a lot of deeper questions about what concepts we really want
people to come away with when they learn a subject.

Here are a few of my takeaways:

## Learning By Building

Before writing the book, Papert had spent a bunch of time teaching children how to program.
He specifically taught the programming language Logo, a simple language in which the programmer
writes out instructions for how a cursor (called a Turtle) ought to move on a screen. Instructions
look like `FORWARD 100` or `RIGHT 120`, and the lanugage allows for writing subroutines (functions).

Having students write programs in Logo taught problem solving skills in a way that many students
failed to pick up doing traditional math. Examples Papert brings up illuminate this--one student,
after solving a math problem and getting it wrong, crossed out their solution and started again
from scratch, thinking that this solution was wrong and that they needed to start over. When
programming in Logo, however, things are different. When you write a program, it's rarely ever
"just correct" when you write it. The process of writing a computer program is an iterative
process of writing code and then *debugging* that code until it is working.

The problem with the way math is traditionally set up, where there are right/wrong answers, less
naturally sets up the iterative problem-solving approach that is more applicable to real world problems.

## Inverting the teacher-student relationship

Another exciting potential that using Logo in the classroom poses is the potential to invert
the way student-teacher relationships work. In the traditional classroom, teachers are "authorities"
who know the right answers, and while students might often work with one another, genuine intellectual
collaborations between student and teacher are rare. It's hard for an adult to *genuinely* collaborate with
on a student on elementary school-level math.

But in a world where students are learning Logo, things are a little bit different. An example that he uses
is that there was an instance where a student couldn't figure out why the Logo program wasn't drawing the
shape that they had intended. The teacher started helping the student debug, and the student asked at one
point "wait, so you don't know the answer??" and when the teacher told them that they didn't, their mind
was blown. The idea that a teacher could be genuinely collaborating with them was so novel.

# Where are we 40 years later?

40 years on from when *Mindstorms* was written, it's clear that we're
pretty far away from the "learning society" Papert was describing. Computers have
largely gone in the direction of devices used for passive consumption,
evidenced by the amount of "computing" that happens on
smartphones and tablets. Programming computers is perceived as an inaccessible
skill by most of the public.

However, there is still experimentation happening with making computing more
accessible (Bret Victor's [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) is one of
my favorite examples), and it's exciting to think about the broader cultural
changes that could happen if that were to be achieved.
